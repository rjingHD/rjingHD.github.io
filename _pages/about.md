Hi there! I am glad that you are visiting my personal website!

 I am a third-year PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/departments-and-divisions/mechanical-engineering/), where I work as a member of [Soft Robotics Control (SRC) Lab](https://sites.bu.edu/srclab/) and [BU Robotics Laboratory](https://sites.bu.edu/robotics/) . I am fortunate to be advised by [Professor Andrew Sabelhaus](https://sites.bu.edu/srclab/profile/andrew-sabelhaus/). Before moving to BU, I obtained a B.Eng in Control Science and Engineering at Shandong University, China and an M.S. in Robotics Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

My research focus pertains to soft robot modelling, learning and control. More specifically, I am passionate about devising data-driven methods, learning approaches and other advanced control technics to facilitate the safe interaction of soft robots with humans and their external environment.

Hope you enjoy my work! Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in my research or potential collaboration.
